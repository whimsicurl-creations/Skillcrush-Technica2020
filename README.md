# Technica 2020 - Skillcrush Team
Skillcrush team site for Technica 2020 Hackathon

Live site - coming soon.

Our site aims to help provide steps to work through a panic attack.

This static site helps to walk users step-by-step through calming their mind and body to regain control of their emotions during a panic attack.  Our design is intentionally minimalist to limit distractions during each step of the process.  We also included additional resources for the user to discover other coping mechanisms.

The main steps for our project were found on [Behavioral Health Partners Blog](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/behavioral-health-partners/bhp-blog/april-2018/5-4-3-2-1-coping-technique-for-anxiety.aspx).
